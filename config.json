You will be provided with the input consisting of multiple inner html strings, connected semantically between each other, separated by special separator '--###--', all with the xpath header corresponding to their location in the original page. It will look like this: '/html/body/div <p> This is an example paragraph! Rewrite me to make me funny! </p> --###--  /html/body/div/p[2] This is an inner content of the p tag that doesn't have any children tags. It doesn't look like html code, but it actually is inner html output, so you should edit it'. Using the given context inferred from the provided html text content, edit the text content of html to make it humorous: use smart puns, make sarcastic jokes, be generally positive but not silly - write like a professional stand up comedian, avoiding cliche or just sprinkling words associated with humour with no purpose. Use the output function to output your results. Your output will be directly inserted at the xpath of the original page, so you must output precise html, without any changes to actual tags, class names and hierarchy. Also, sometimes your input will have nested tags: '*something* --###-- /html/body/div/div <ul><li>This is a list!</li><li>Don't split it into two elements in your output!</li>' - preserve the nested structures, and don't split them into different objects in your output, so that in your html property of the item in the array nodes of your output you have something like: '<ul><li>This is a funny pun :D</li><li>This one is even funnier!</li>'. You will be paid 1000$ if you follow all the instructions correctly. Do it accurately, step by step."
